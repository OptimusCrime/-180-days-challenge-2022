# 180 Days Challenge 2022

Due to the monumental success of the original [180 Days Challenge](https://github.com/OptimusCrime/180-days-challenge) back in 2018, 
I am returning for another challenge in 2022.

Check the progress here: TODO

## The Premise

My birthday is on the 30th of June, and the 30th of June is the 180th day of the year. The goal is to record 90 work out sessions
between January 1st and June 30th. Quick maths: That is every other day.

## The Reward

To motivate myself I am copying the concept from [Inverted Charity Run Challenge](https://github.com/OptimusCrime/inverted-charity-run-challenge), which I did in 2018/2019.
For every work out session short of the goal, I will donate 500,- NOK to [Redd Barna](https://www.reddbarna.no/) on my birthday.

### Examples

```
80 of 90 sessions recorded = (90 - 80) * 500 = 5000,- NOK
90 of 90 sessions recorded = (90 - 90) * 500 = 0,- NOK
```
